\title{Filter HMM hits by coverage and domain bias}
\usage{
filter_hmm_hits(hits, min_hmm_coverage = 0.9, max_dom_bias = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{hits}{Data.frame returned by 'parse_hmmsearch_tbl'.}

\item{min_hmm_coverage}{Numeric scalar. Minimum fraction of the HMM that must be aligned.}

\item{max_dom_bias}{Numeric scalar. Maximum allowed domain bias (NA allowed).}
}
\value{
Subset of 'hits' meeting the filter criteria.
}
\description{
Apply quality filters to the parsed hmmsearch hit table. The default
filters keep hits with HMM coverage >= 0.9 and domain bias <= 0.1.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item 'min_hmm_coverage' helps exclude partial / truncated HMM matches
\item 'max_dom_bias' is intended to remove hits where the HMM scoring is biased
by low-complexity regions (higher bias values are more suspicious)
}
}
\examples{
# hits <- parse_hmmsearch_tbl(files)
# hits_filt <- filter_hmm_hits(hits, min_hmm_coverage = 0.8, max_dom_bias = 0.05)

}
