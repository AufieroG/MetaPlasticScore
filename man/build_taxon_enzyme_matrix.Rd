\title{Build taxon × enzyme matrix from HMM hits}
\usage{
build_taxon_enzyme_matrix(hits)
}
\arguments{
\item{hits}{Data.frame produced by 'parse_hmmsearch_tbl' (preferably filtered).}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix with rownames = taxon_id and colnames = enzyme_id.
}
\description{
Aggregate parsed HMM hits to produce a matrix whose rows are taxon identifiers
and columns are enzyme identifiers. Cell values are counts of unique target
sequences observed for that taxon-enzyme pair.
}
\details{
The function:
\itemize{
\item deduplicates 'target_name' per taxon-enzyme pair,
\item counts unique targets per taxon × enzyme,
\item constructs a dense matrix filled with zeros for missing pairs.
}

Use this matrix to compute per-taxon enzyme load (row sums) or to map enzymes
to taxa for downstream calculations.

\examples{
# agg_mat <- build_taxon_enzyme_matrix(hits_filt)
