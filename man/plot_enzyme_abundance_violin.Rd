\title{Violin plot of enzyme abundance by condition with Wilcoxon test}
\usage{
plot_enzyme_abundance_violin(
  enzyme_by_sample,
  meta,
  sample_col,
  condition_col,
  cfg = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{enzyme_by_sample}{Numeric matrix or data.frame with rows = enzymes and
columns = samples.}

\item{meta}{Data.frame containing sample metadata.}

\item{sample_col}{Character(1). Column name in \code{meta} containing sample IDs.}

\item{condition_col}{Character(1). Column name in \code{meta} defining groups
(two levels expected).}

\item{cfg}{Optional configuration list (e.g. from \code{default_plot_config()}).}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing enzyme abundance distributions by condition with
Wilcoxon test annotations.
}
\description{
Generate a violin plot (with overlaid boxplot and jittered points) showing
raw enzyme abundance across experimental conditions. For each enzyme,
a two-group Wilcoxon (Mann–Whitney) test is performed and the FDR-adjusted
p-value is annotated on the plot.
}
\details{
The function expects an enzyme-by-sample abundance matrix (rows = enzymes,
columns = samples) and a metadata table linking sample IDs to experimental
conditions. The Wilcoxon test is computed independently for each enzyme.

Assumptions:
\itemize{
\item Exactly two groups are present in \code{condition_col}.
\item Column names of \code{enzyme_by_sample} match sample IDs in \code{meta}.
}

P-values are adjusted across enzymes using the Benjamini–Hochberg (FDR) method.
