\title{Wilcoxon test for plastic scores across two groups}
\usage{
compute_plastic_score_test(plastic_score, metadata, sample_col, condition_col)
}
\arguments{
\item{plastic_score}{Named numeric vector of sample-level scores (names = sample IDs).}

\item{metadata}{Data.frame containing sample metadata, (columns: Samples and    Groups).}

\item{sample_col}{Character(1). Column name in 'metadata' that contains sample IDs.}

\item{condition_col}{Character(1). Column name in 'metadata' that contains group labels.}
}
\value{
An object of class 'htest' produced by 'wilcox.test'.
}
\description{
Perform a two-group Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) test comparing the plastic score
distribution between groups defined in metadata.
}
\details{
The function merges 'plastic_score' with 'metadata' using 'sample_col', then
runs 'wilcox.test(score ~ group)'. It is intended for two-group comparisons.
}
\examples{
# res <- compute_plastic_score_test(score_vector, metadata, "Samples", "Groups")
